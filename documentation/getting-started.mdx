Quick start guide for Xata's PostgreSQL platform\
Xata is a PostgreSQL platform that provides instant Copy-on-Write branching, data masking, and separation of storage from compute. It's designed for modern teams running PostgreSQL at scale, with features like zero-downtime schema changes, realistic staging environments, and cloud-agnostic deployment options.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up" titleSize="h2">
    Create your free Xata account at [console.xata.io](https://console.xata.io/). You can sign up with GitHub, Google, or your email address.

    **Note:** Xata is currently in private beta, please request access and wait for approval before proceeding.

  </Step>

  <Step title='Create a project' titleSize='h2'>
    After signing in, create a new project. A project is the top-level container
    for all your branches and Postgres instances.

    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title='Create a branch' titleSize='h2'>
    Within your project, create your first branch (e.g., `main`). A branch is a
    Postgres clusterâ€”a collection of one or more Postgres instances, which can
    include a primary and optional replicas. When creating your main branch, you
    can choose the Postgres version, region, and instance size to fit your needs.
    This branch can serve as your production branch or a staging environment. You
    can branch off `main` at any time to create isolated development or test
    environments.

  </Step>

  <Step title='Install and configure the Xata CLI' titleSize='h2'>
    Install the Xata CLI:

    ```bash 
curl -fsSL https://xata.io/install.sh | bash 
    ```
    Authenticate with your Xata account: 
    
    ```bash 
xata auth login 
    ```
    
    Initialize your project by running this command in your project directory: 
    ```bash 
xata init
    ``` 
    
    This will create a `.xata` directory with your project configuration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable schema history" titleSize="h2">
    Go to the **Branches** section and select your branch (e.g., `main`). Here you can view your schema and enable schema history for zero-downtime schema changes.
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/getting-started/branch-details.png" alt="Branch details/schema view" />
    </Frame>


    To enable schema history, run:

    ```bash
    xata roll init
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create initial tables" titleSize="h2">
    Using `xata roll`, we can now safely create a migration file for our initial schema:
    
    ```bash
    cat > .xata/migrations/001_initial_schema.yaml << 'EOL'
        operations:
          - create_table:
              name: products
              columns:
                - name: id
                  type: serial
                - name: name
                  type: text
                - name: price
                  type: numeric(7,2)
              constraints:
                - name: products_pk
                  type: primary_key
                  columns:
                    - id
          - create_table:
              name: orders
              columns:
                - name: id
                  type: serial
                - name: created_at
                  type: timestamptz
                  default: now()
              constraints:
                - name: orders_pk
                  type: primary_key
                  columns:
                    - id
          - create_table:
              name: order_items
              columns:
                - name: order_id
                  type: int
                - name: product_id
                  type: int
                - name: qty
                  type: int
              constraints:
                - name: order_items_pk
                  type: primary_key
                  columns:
                    - order_id
                    - product_id
                - name: order_items_order_id_fk
                  type: foreign_key
                  columns:
                    - order_id
                  references:
                    table: orders
                    columns:
                      - id
                - name: order_items_product_id_fk
                  type: foreign_key
                  columns:
                    - product_id
                  references:
                    table: products
                    columns:
                      - id
        EOL
    ```

    Apply the migration:

    ```bash
xata roll migrate --complete true
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Insert sample data" titleSize="h2">
    Let's insert some sample data using `psql`. If you don't have `psql` installed:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS">
        ```bash
        brew install libpq
            echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
            source ~/.zshrc
        ```

        If you are using bash, replace `~/.zshrc` with `~/.bash_profile` in the above.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Ubuntu">
        ```bash
        sudo apt install postgresql-client-17
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
        Download from [PostgreSQL official site.](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
    
        Connect to `psql` with your dev branch connection string

        ```bash
        psql `xata branch url`
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Then run the following SQL to insert sample data:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO products(name,price) SELECT LEFT(md5(i::text),8),(random()*90+10)::numeric(7,2) FROM generate_series(1,10)i;

    WITH o AS (INSERT INTO orders DEFAULT VALUES RETURNING id) INSERT INTO order_items(order_id,product_id,qty) SELECT o.id,pid,(1+floor(random()\*3))::int FROM o,(SELECT id pid FROM products ORDER BY random() LIMIT 5)p;
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title='Create a development branch with the CLI' titleSize='h2'>
    Create a new branch from `main`:
    
    ```bash
  xata branch create --name dev --parent-branch `xata branch get id`
    ```
    This command will automatically checkout the new branch for you.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Add a column' titleSize='h2'>
    Let's add a rating column to the products table using pgroll. Create a new migration file:
    ```bash
  cat > .xata/migrations/002_add_rating_column.yaml << 'EOL'
        operations:
          - alter_table:
              name: products
              columns:
                - name: rating
                  type: int
  EOL
    ```
    Apply the migration to your dev branch:
    ```bash
  xata roll migrate
    ```
    This will add the `rating` column to the products table.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check the schema diff in the branch details page" titleSize="h2">
  After making changes in a branch, use the **Schema Diff** feature in the `dev` branch details page to compare your branch with its parent.
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/getting-started/schema-diff.png" alt="Schema diff page" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge your changes back to main" titleSize="h2">
  Now that you've made changes in your dev branch, you'll need to checkout `main` branch and apply the local migrations from your `dev` branch:
  ```bash
  xata checkout main
  xata roll migrate
    ```
    This will apply your dev branch's schema changes to main.

    To view the status of the migration:

    ```bash
  xata roll status
    ```
    Once you're happy with the shcema change, you can complete the migration:

    ```bash
  xata roll complete
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start from a clean slate" titleSize="h2">
  Now that you're all set up, let's get you reset and ready to start building.

  Delete the `dev` branch:
  ```bash
  xata branch delete dev
  ```
  Finally, let's clean up the sample tables using a `xata roll` migration. Create a migration to drop all the tables:

  ```bash
  cat > .xata/migrations/003_cleanup_tables.yaml << 'EOL'
      operations:
        - drop_table:
            name: order_items
        - drop_table:
            name: orders
        - drop_table:
            name: products
      EOL
  ```
  Apply the cleanup migration:
  ```bash
  xata roll migrate --complete true
  ```
  This will leave your main branch clean for your next project or migration.
